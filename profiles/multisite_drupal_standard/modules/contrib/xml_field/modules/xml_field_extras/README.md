## Note on Function Names

Except when required for Drupal integration `xml_field_extras` module simply uses the `xml_field_` prefix, rather than the conventional `xml_field_extras_` prefix for it's function naming.  This is a dependent module by definition and this strategy serves to have a more cohesive API, as well as shorter function names.
