INTRODUCTION
------------

The jPlayer module provides a wrapper around the jPlayer JavaScript library.
This library provides an HTML5-based player, that uses a Flash fallback for
browsers that do not support it. This module provides a default presentation for
the player, as well as integration with file fields. This makes it possible to
easily convert the display of any file field into an audio or video player.

This player will work with the media types jPlayer supports: mp3, m4a, m4v, oga,
ogv, webma, webmv, wav. (Also jpeg, jpg and png for poster artwork.) Please be
sure to restrict the file upload extensions on your file fields to only allow
these extensions, or less depending on your requirements.


INSTALLATION
------------

 1. Drop the 'jplayer' folder into the modules directory '/sites/all/modules/'.

 2. Download jPlayer from http://www.jplayer.org/download/.

 3. Expand the zip or tar.gz file and then copy the dist/jplayer folder to 'sites/all/libraries/jplayer/'.

 4. In your Drupal site, enable the module under Administration -> Modules.

 5. Global admin settings for jPlayer can be found Administration ->
    Configuration -> jPlayer 'admin/config/media/jplayer'.

 6. When you manage the display of file fields within your content types
    'admin/structure/types/manage/{type}/display', choose 'jPlayer - Player'
    as the format. You can then configure the settings available for that
    instance.


PLAYER KINDS
------------

When configuring your formatter you will be given the option of two 'kinds' of 
jPlayer. Below is the difference between them:

 1. Single
    
    Intelligent single instance player which can take multiple formats of the
    same kind e.g. ogv and m4v and display the correct one depending on your
    browser. Also takes image files for poster frames. Works with both audio
    and video.
    
    For use on a multi-value file field, or single value if you only want to
    support one kind of media.
    
    If you happen to upload a video file type then the jPlayer player will
    automatically convert itself into a video player.

 2. Playlist
    
    For use on a multi-value file field. Each file uploaded will be added to a
    playlist. Which users will be able to navigation between. If you upload a
    video file then the player will convert to a video player automatically. If
    audio files are also present then a blank video frame will be displayed.
    
    You can also select your repeat option. If set to 'All' then the player will
    play all files within the playlist one after the other, once it reaches the
    end it will start again at the beginning. If set to 'Single' then it will
    repeat a single file within the playlist until the user chooses to play
    another file.


THEMING
------------

The jPlayer default output uses a lot of CSS to get the player looking
respectable. This default set of CSS is based on the demonstration skin provided
at http://www.happyworm.com/jquery/jplayer/latest/demos.htm.

Note that the default HTML output of jPlayer module is a standard template that
other "skins" may work with. It is highly suggest to not override the
jplayer.tpl.php file and instead build all your custom theming on top of the
default HTML through CSS.

To override the CSS file:

 * Copy (or create a new .css file) and place it in your theme with the same
   name as the original (jplayer.css).

 * In your theme .info file, add the line:

     stylesheets[all][] = jplayer.css

   to point to the new css file in your theme. If your file is a sub-directory,
   you will need adjust the stylesheet declaration to include that
   sub-directory.

     stylesheets[all][] = css/jplayer.css

   jplayer.css and jplayer.jpg have to be in the same folder, so if you want to
   override one of them copy also the other one. For more information, see
   https://drupal.org/node/263967.

To override the Javascript file:

 * Copy (or create a new .js file) and place it in your theme with the same
   name as the original (jplayer.js).

 * In your theme .info file, add the line:

     scripts[] = jplayer.js

   to point to new new javascript file in your theme. If your file is a
   sub-directory, you will adjust the JavaScript declaration to include that
   sub-directory.

   For more information, see http://drupal.org/node/171213.


UPGRADING
---------

Since the jPlayer module is purely a formatter most of the upgrade work required
will be in upgrading from old CCK File Fields into new core File Fields in
Drupal 7. Apart from that you will need to re-select your formatters after
upgrading to this new version.


SUPPORT
-------

Many issues you may have may be caused by jPlayer library itself, rather than
the Drupal module. Check with the jPlayer support pages for issues with Flash
warnings or the player behaving oddly:

If the problem is with the jPlayer Drupal module, please file a support request
at http://drupal.org/project/issues/jplayer.

FAQ
___

Q: Player is not visible onscreen
A1: is the widget type for the field set to 'jPlayer'? If in doubt, check the
 html for the page includes elements with classes such as jp-audio or
 jp-playlist in the expected area).
A2: has the jplayer module's CSS been included on the page?
A3: has the jPlayer JS been included on the page?

Q: Player apparently there but is completely unresponsive (no JS events attached
 to controls)
A1: check to see that JavaScript enabled on your browser
A2: Check that you are not relying on a version of Flash being installed that
 isn't present or is too old.
A3: check you are using jQuery >= 1.4 and jQuery <= 2.0.

Q: Player active (JS events applied, buttons respond when clicked), but won't
 play
A1: Check that the browser and platform you're testing with is able to play the
 files you're giving it when given a direct link. For example, some Linux-based
  platforms have no support for mp3 file playback out of the box.
A2: See http://jplayer.org/ for supported file formats.

Q: Which versions of the jPlayer library are known to work with the module?
A1: The Drupal 7 jplayer module has been tested against jPlayer version 2.9.2.
