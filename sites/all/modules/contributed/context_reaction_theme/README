Context Reaction Theme for Context 3.x for Drupal 7.x
---------------------------------------------------------
Context Reaction Theme provides a reaction for Context that switches the
active theme. If you are already familiar with the Context module and its
conditions and reactions then this module should be very straightforward!

Installation
------------
1. Context Reaction Theme can be installed like any other Drupal module - place
it in the modules directory for your site and enable it.

2. You must clear all caches (the button on the admin/settings/performance
screen is one way to do it) in order to see the new reaction that is provided
by this module.
