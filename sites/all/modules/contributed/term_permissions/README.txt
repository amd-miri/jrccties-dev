= Taxonomy Term Permissions =

This module allows taxonomy administrators the ability to restrict setting
individual terms on nodes by user or role. This developed out of a need to
allow limiting creation of specific newsletters in the SimpleNews module to a
user or role. For example, franchise owners can be limited to their own
newsletters while managers can have access to all newsletters. However, the
module could be applied to other situations where specific terms are considered
to be "privileged" terms, such as marking a wiki page as stable or verified.

== Installation and Use ==

To install the Taxonomy Term Permissions module, extract the module to your
modules folder, such as sites/all/modules. After enabling the module, each term
can be assigned permissions when adding or editing a term at Administer >
Structure > Taxonomy. If no permissions are assigned, all users may
access the term. If a user may not access any terms in a required vocabulary,
they will be denied access to the node form entirely.

== Help and Support ==

The module is currently sponsored by 3Ring.com for use on AmeriSpec.ca.
