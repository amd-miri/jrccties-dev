OVERVIEW
===========
This module is a complete re-write of the old Comment OG module, and should be treated as a new module. 

INSTALLATION
============
Just install as you would install any module by placing it in your modules directory and enabling it the usual way.

WHAT IT DOES
============
The module does the following to all Organic Group-affiliated nodes:

-removes the comment link for non-members
-removes the reply link on comments for non-members
-disables the comment form for non-members
-gives group admins the ability to delete comments within their groups (ignoring core comment module access)

That's it. Pretty simple. No further configuration is required. 

KNOWN ISSUES
============
I've never tried this module with a comment queue, although the queue permissioning would be problematic within the
context of Organic Groups. Also I feel like some of these features should be configurable, but I'll add that in a 
future release if I get a request for it via the issue queue (*wink wink*).
