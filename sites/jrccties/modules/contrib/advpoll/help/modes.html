    <h1>Advanced Poll Voting Modes</h1>
    <p>Advanced poll offers three voting modes that can be set for each poll.</p>
    <dl>
      <dt>Normal</dt>
      <dd>Normal voting follows the base behavior of the Voting API. For instance, if
          anonymous users are allowed to vote, the default behavior of Voting API is to track
          users via their IP address. Authenticated users are tracked by both their IP and UID.</dd>
      <dt>Cookie</dt>
      <dd>Cookie tracking allows you to limit voting by cookie and can overcome issues caused
          by tracking voting data via IP.  Each poll may have its own
          expiration time.  It's important to note, however, that a user can easily clear their
          browser cache and vote more than once.</dd>
      <dt>Unlimited</dt>
      <dd>Unlimited voting allows a user to vote as many times as they wish each time they
          refresh the page.</dd>
    </dl>
